# Deals
## Problem Statement 
A limited time deal implies that a seller will put up an item on sale for a limited time period, say, 2 hours and will keep a maximum limit on the number of items that would be sold as part of that deal. 
Users cannot buy the deal if the deal time is over 
Users cannot buy if the maximum allowed deal has already been bought by other users.
One user cannot buy more than one item as part of the deal.

Task is to create APIs to enable following operations
Create a deal with price and number of items to be sold as part of the deal
End a deal 
Update a deal to increase the number of items or end time
Claim a deal

## Implemention
Create an API to list all the items which are having deals
Create an API to purchase items on deal
Create an API to check the timings on deal
Once the item has been purchased the totalQuantity of the item should reduce by 1 
It is an MVC structure, hibernate was used for DataBase Connectivity through JPA/DAOLayer
What I wanted to do:

Create three tables:
User:                items:           deals:
User_id              item_id          deal_id
name                 item_name        item_id
Dealavail            quantity         start_time
                                      end_time
API                            
POST/purchase{user_id,item_id}
